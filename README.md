👋 Hi, I'm Simon — a software developer based in NYC. 

I specialize in Android app development and am passionate about building amazing apps at scale. When I'm not writing software either at work or at home, I'm probably consuming scifi content of some form or exploring NYC by public transit. Check out my website at [simon.duchastel.com](https://simon.duchastel.com)!

## ✨ What I'm currently working on
- 🤖 Creating my own [Simple Launcher](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/simple-launcher) app for Android to give myself total control over my Android home screen.
- 📸 Building [Photo Swiper](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/photo-categorizer), an android app to categorize your event photos via a swiping interface.
- 🚀 Building [Brainiac](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/solenne-chat), scaffolding to give agentic AI long-term dynamic memory.
- 📝 Writing about software, books, and personal projects on my [website](https://simon.duchastel.com).
