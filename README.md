👋 Hi, I'm Simon — a software developer based in NYC. 

I specialize in Android development and am passionate about building amazing apps at scale. When I'm not writing software either at work or at home, I'm probably reading scifi or exploring NYC by public transit. Check out my website at [simon.duchastel.com](https://simon.duchastel.com)!
