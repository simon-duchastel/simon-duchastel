👋 Hi, I'm Simon — a software developer based in NYC.

I'm a software engineer specializing in Android app development, passionate about building amazing apps at scale. When I'm not writing software either at work or on the side, I'm probably consuming scifi content of some form or exploring NYC by public transit. Check out my website at [simon.duchastel.com](https://simon.duchastel.com)!

✨ What I'm doing currently
- 🚀 Building [Solenne](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/solenne-chat), a flexible AI chat frontend with remote MCP capabilities
- 📝 Writing about software, books, and personal projects on my [website](https://simon.duchastel.com)

Like my work? You can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/simonduchastel).
