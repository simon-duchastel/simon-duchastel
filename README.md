👋 Hi, I'm Simon — a software developer based in NYC. 

I'm a software engineer specializing in Android app development, passionate about building amazing apps at scale. When I'm not writing software either at work or on the side, I'm probably consuming scifi content of some form or exploring NYC by public transit. Check out my website at [simon.duchastel.com](https://simon.duchastel.com)!

## ✨ What I'm currently working on
- 🤖 Creating my own [Simple Launcher](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/simple-launcher) app for Android to give myself total control over my Android home screen
- 🚀 Building [Solenne](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/solenne-chat), an AI chat frontend for mobile, web, and desktop with remote MCP capabilities
- 📝 Writing about software, books, and personal projects on my [website](https://simon.duchastel.com)
