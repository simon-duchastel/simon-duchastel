👋 Hi, I'm Simon — a software developer based in NYC. 

I specialize in Android app development and am passionate about building amazing apps at scale. When I'm not writing software either at work or at home, I'm probably consuming scifi content of some form or exploring NYC by public transit. Check out my website at [simon.duchastel.com](https://simon.duchastel.com)!

## ✨ What I'm currently working on
- 🪄 Building [Solenne Flashcards](https://flashcards.solenne.ai), an AI-powered flashcard generator written in Kotlin Multiplatform for the web, ios, and android
- 🤖 Working on [Brainiac](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/brainiac), my own personal AI assistant both for learning and cusotomization purposes
- 📝 Writing about software, books, and personal projects on my [website](https://simon.duchastel.com).
